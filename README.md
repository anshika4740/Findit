🧠 Findit Portal
An AI-powered platform to help people find their lost items easily

Findit is a web app that helps users report and search for lost or found items using Artificial Intelligence (AI).
It uses both image and text recognition to automatically match lost items with found ones — making it faster and easier to reunite people with their belongings.
